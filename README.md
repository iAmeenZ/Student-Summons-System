# Student Summons System
Student Summons System is an application system for college students who violate University rules. Completed on 7 October 2020.

It is a system of filling in to students and payment of students against the summons imposed. The system has two login sections namely the student and the admin (the enforcer who issues the summons).

Students can view a list of summonses, pay summonses and view summonses that have already been paid. Admin can fill, remove and update the summons against a student.

This project is developed in groups to get marks in the subject of Information System Development. It was developed by another group, yet 70% asked for my help to develop this system.
